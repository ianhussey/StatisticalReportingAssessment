Results An independent t-test indicated …, t(50) = 14.52, p < 0.001, d = 4.02 (95%CI=3.03,5.03), one tailed. Second, an independent t-test demonstrated that …, t(49.82) = -2.24, p = .015, d = -0.62 (95%CI=-1.2,-0.03), one tailed.
… were assessed using an independent t-test on the ratings change scores. This demonstrated significant differences of large effect size, t(46.26) = -3.14, p = .001, d = -0.87 (95%CI=-1.46,-0.27, one tailed. Self-report ratings … (M∆ = -0.29, SD = .53) whereas … (M∆= 0.12, SD = .40). A post hoc power analysis indicated that this comparison was well powered (1 – β = 0.99, one tailed). It should be noted that results were robust to employing the alternate strategy of an ANCOVA with … entered as a covariate, F(1, 49) = 11.19, p = .001, η2 = 0.12.
